## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I've been enjoying web development for the first time ever since I built my first Go project "stackwrapr". The consolidated toolchain makes me want to leave the JavaScript ecosystem  behind for good. I'm currently on the look out for a role in backend web development, ideally writing Go or Python. I'd especially love to work at a start up on a tight team where I can make an impact quickly. If you're hiring, lets chat!
